This project simulates the behavior of different traffic light control algorithms for a grid of intersecting roads.

Each road is bi-directional with one lane per direction. 

Arrival of the vehicles follows poisson distribution.

Different traffic control algorithms can be developed and evaluated under this framework.

Various metrics such as total travel time, total waiting time at intersections, total number of stops in the journey, average platoon size (fleet of vehicles traveling across the intersection in one green phase) etc are calculated. Hence, this serves as an evaluation framework for different intersection traffic control algorithms.
